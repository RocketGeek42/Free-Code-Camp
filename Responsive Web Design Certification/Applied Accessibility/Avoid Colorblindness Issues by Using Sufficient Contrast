<!-- Camper Cat is experimenting with using color for his blog text and
background, but his current combination of a greenish background-color
with maroon text color has a 2.5:1 contrast ratio. You can easily adjust
the lightness of the colors since he declared them using the CSS hsl()
property (which stands for hue, saturation, lightness) by changing the
third argument. Increase the background-color lightness value from 35%
to 55%, and decrease the color lightness value from 20% to 15%. This
improves the contrast to 5.9:1.-->
